<h1>The Best Movies according to Santosh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 moveis of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Passion of Christ</h3>
<p>Reflects the love of God that Lord Jesus Christ died for this world. He took away our sins.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p> I like the hero's smartness in escaping one of the tight prisons.</p>

<h3>Intesteller</h3>
<p>It is sci-fic movie which reflects age difference with other planets.</p>
